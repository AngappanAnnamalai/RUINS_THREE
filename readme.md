## I will be adding camera movements and many more interactions to this, and I'm planning on hosting it through Vercel, by following bruno's course. I'll share the link with you through mail or linkedIn whenever I finish it sir. 

## Thank You for this course sir, I pushed myself to finally learn blender, and I'm exploring THREE.JS with great interest too!
